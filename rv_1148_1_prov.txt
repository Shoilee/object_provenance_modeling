Attribution â—Š is the ascribing of an entity to an agent.
When an entity e is attributed to agent ag, entity e was generated by some unspecified activity that in turn was associated to agent ag. Thus, this relation is useful when the activity is not known, or irrelevant.

An entity is a physical(a mountain, a building, a printed book, or a ca), digital( a file or web page), conceptual(abrtract concept or ideas), or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary

Agents are defined as having some kind of responsibility for activities.

We can use further subtype or relation, but in this study we only used main type, except time for activity, because this already satisfy the requirement.
